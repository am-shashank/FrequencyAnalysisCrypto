# FrequencyAnalysisCrypto
Java application that attempts to decrypt a document that has been encrypted using a substitution cipher encryption algorithm. Then the program will estimate the accuracy of this approach using a technique called cross-validation. Focus is not on encryption or decryption algorithms. Instead, focus is on writing good quality, reusable and easily maintainable code.
